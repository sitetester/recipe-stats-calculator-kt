2. The number of distinct postcodes is lower than `1M`, one postcode is not longer than `10` chars.
3. The number of distinct recipe names is lower than `2K`, one recipe name is not longer than `100` chars.

Functional Requirements
------

1. Count the number of unique recipe names.
2. Count the number of occurrences for each unique recipe name (alphabetically ordered by recipe name).
3. Find the postcode with most delivered recipes.
4. Count the number of deliveries to postcode `10120` that lie within the delivery time between `10AM` and `3PM`,
   examples _(`12AM` denotes midnight)_:
   - `NO` - `9AM - 2PM`
   - `YES` - `10AM - 2PM`
5. List the recipe names (alphabetically ordered) that contain in their name one of the following words:
   - Potato
   - Veggie
   - Mushroom

Expected output

Generate a JSON file of the following format:

```json5
{
    "unique_recipe_count": 15,
    "count_per_recipe": [
        {
            "recipe": "Mediterranean Baked Veggies",
            "count": 1
        },

            "count": 3
        }
    ],
    "busiest_postcode": {
        "postcode": "10120",
        "delivery_count": 1000
    },
    "count_per_postcode_and_time": {
        "postcode": "10120",
        "from": "11AM",
        "to": "3PM",
